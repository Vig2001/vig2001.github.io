# Welcome to My GitHub Pages Site

Hello! This is my portfolio website, where I have listed some of my most prominent projects so far.

## About Me

I am a MSci Mathematics graduate (1st Class Honours) from Imperial College London with a strong interest for machine learning and data science. At university I completed courses in Mathematical Foundations for Machine Learning, Methods for Data Science, Scientific Computation and a research project on Modelling the Heterogeneity in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. I am particularly passionate about pursuing a career in machine learning for healthcare.
