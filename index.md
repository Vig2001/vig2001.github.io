## About Me

Hello! My name is Vignesh. I recently graduated from Imperial College London with a first-class MSci Mathematics degree. During the latter half of the programme, I specialised in statistics and data science where I enjoyed learning about the foundations of deep learning.

As part of my Master's, I worked on a research project with Dr Christopher Hallsworth, focusing on modelling the heterogeneity in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. The goal was to develop a novel scoring method to better explain the differences in patient motor abilities, so that drug testing / approval could be more informative and trustworthy. The project really highlighted how advances in statistics and computing can make a big difference in improving clinical outcomes, sparking my passion for the applications of deep learning to healthcare.

**Interests:** Interpretability and Causality in Deep Learning<br>
**Programming Languages:** Python, R, Julia, SQL<br>
**Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace<br>
**Version Control:** Git
